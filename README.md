# Chicago's Kotlin Style

This is an initiative by the Chicago's Kotlin User Group ([Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T09229ZC6/C5GGU291C)) 
to make a compilation of style and guidances for writing Kotlin code.

It is inspired by the [Springer Nature Kotlin playbook](https://github.com/springernature/kotlin-playbook)

And assumes that you use the [Kotlin Coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html)
